# AirCNC - RocketSeat

(React.JS, Node.JS, React Native, Expo, Websockets, MongoDB) - The Air CNC (Code and Coffe) app allows companies to publish some spots for outside devs who wish to code near company devs and perhaps, get hired. Companies publish their spots and interesting devs can ask for renting the spot. In real-time, the company gets the notification and can accept or decline the ask.
